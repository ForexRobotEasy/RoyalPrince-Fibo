# RoyalPrince Fibo - Trend Detection Algorithm

This code represents the RoyalPrince Fibo trend detection algorithm developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The algorithm aims to detect market trends and provide accurate trade alerts for advanced trend detection in the Forex market.

## How it Works

The code consists of several functions that work together to analyze market trends and update the alert system with the calculated trend percentage. Here is a breakdown of each function and its purpose:

### TrendDetection()

This function is responsible for detecting and analyzing market trends. It calls the `CalculateTrendPercentage()` function to calculate the trend percentage and then updates the alert system using the `UpdateAlertSystem()` function.

### CalculateTrendPercentage()

This function calculates the trend percentage by implementing a specific algorithm. The exact details of the algorithm are not provided in the code, and it should be implemented according to the user's strategy and requirements.

### UpdateAlertSystem(double trendPercentage)

This function updates the alert system with the calculated trend percentage. It can be customized to send alerts through various channels such as email, SMS, or push notifications. The specific implementation of the alert system is not provided in the code and should be tailored to the user's preferences.

### TradingFunctions()

This function includes additional trading functions that can be added by the user. It serves as a placeholder where users can add their own trading strategies, indicators, or any other functionality required for their specific trading system.

### OnStart()

The `OnStart()` function is the main entry point of the code. It calls the `TrendDetection()` function to initiate the trend detection process and then proceeds to execute any additional trading functions added in the `TradingFunctions()`.
